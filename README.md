Welcome to the Task Management App project! This web application is built using React.js, Material-UI (MUI), Firebase as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) for data storage and authentication, and leverages JavaScript for functionality, including drag-and-drop capabilities for task management.

**Introduction**
The Task Management System is designed to help users organize their tasks efficiently. To use this system, users must register and log in. Once logged in, users can create, read, update, and delete tasks. Tasks can be categorized, and they can be moved between three bases: Todo, Progress, and Completed, using a drag-and-drop interface.

**Features**
- User registration and login.
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks.
- Task categorization.
- Drag-and-drop functionality for moving tasks between Todo, Progress, and Completed bases.
- Technologies Used
- This project is built using the following technologies:

**React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
**Material-UI (MUI)**: A popular React UI framework for creating stylish and responsive user interfaces.
**Firebase**: A BaaS platform for handling authentication, data storage, and deployment.
**JavaScript**: The primary programming language used for functionality.
**React Beautiful Dnd**: A library for adding drag-and-drop functionality to React applications.
